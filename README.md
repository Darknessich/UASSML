# Droplet Deposition Prediction using UAV Parameters

This project is part of a Bachelor's thesis focused on predicting pesticide droplet deposition characteristics using UAV operational parameters.

## Goal

To analyze how drone flight settings affect:
- **Droplet coverage area**
- **Droplet volume**

using regression models trained on available datasets.
